A plugin for Zim-wiki that adds support for YAML attributes and uses them to
export a site with Pandoc. Each exported page can be rendered with a different
template.

Templates can be built from smaller parts that are shared between different templates.

Static texts in templates can be translated to the language of the exported pages.
