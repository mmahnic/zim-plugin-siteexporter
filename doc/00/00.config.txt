==== Site Exporter Attributes ====
Attributes are inherited from the parent pages. The attributes defined in the child page override the attributes defined in parent pages. Dictionary and list attributes are not merged. The top-level attribute is replaced with a new one, instead.

* //lang//: the default language of the site. If the default language is not set and an exported page does not define the //lang// attribute, the current system locale language will be used.
* //publish//: boolean; //true// if the page and subpages should be published, //false// otherwise. A child page can not be published if the parent is not published.
* //home//: an absolute Zim path to the page that is the homepage of the site.
* //active//: a relative Zim path to the active configuration for the site exporter.
* //titlePrefix//, //tilteSuffix//: see [[:00:00.config:example|example.]]
