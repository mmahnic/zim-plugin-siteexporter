[*] The exporter will use the default template (default.html5) and css (default.css) to generate the site unless there exists a special template for the page or its parent. If the path to the page is "root:subpage:subsub" the template is named "root.subpage.subsub.html5". 
	[*] If a page is moved its template has to be renamed; use template attribute, instead
		* order: template, type, default
[*] Each page type can have a separate template
[*] Define a ~~template~~ page type for subtrees
	* ~~childTemplate~~ //childType// - the default ~~template~~ page type for all the descendants
[*] Templates should be able to use translated texts
[ ] Add 'index' type that generates a list of children of a page. Similar to 'news' but finds children only.
[*] Support multiple translated variables in a single line
[*] Multiple links to markdown pages must be converted to links to html in a single line when preprocessing markdown
[ ] The format of the date for active news items should be configurable
[*] The links in the excerpts are broken; when preparing excerpts, ~~make (markdown) links absolute and mark them for processing later if necessary~~. The links can be made relative to the index page.
[ ] Create an index of //news.index// pages that will be displayed besides the news in every news page
	* A subtype (//childType//) must be defined for descendants so that the index can be displayed in them
	* An ancestor must have a page type whose processor is NewsPageProcessor
	* //news.archive// type may not be required any more
[ ] Define parameters to create Pandoc outputs other than HTML
	* destination format
	* template filename extension
	* extensions of other files that depend on the page type and are used by the templates
[*] @bug Only one notebook can be exported if multiple notebooks are open
[x] Adjust links to template resources in templates [@href banner-image banner.jpeg @] -> templateProcessor.hrefVars
	* css url can be used, instead

TODO: @maybe
[ ] define the order of fall-back transaltions when a translation for the current language does not exist
