====== Page Attributes ======

menu: Attributes
---

Page attributes are defined in YAML blocks of code at the beginning of each page. 
Attributes are inherited from parent pages. Attributes defined in a child page override the same attributes defined in parent pages. Dictionary and list attributes are not merged. Instead, a top-level attribute of the parent is replaced with a new one with the same name from the child.
