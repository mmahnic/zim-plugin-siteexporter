The configuration of the site is stored under the page [[00]]. The relative path to the active configuration is stored in the //active// attribute of the page [[00:00.config]] .

Configuration page [[+attribute|attributes]] are inherited from parent pages. Attributes defined in a child page override the same attributes defined in parent pages. Dictionary and list attributes are not merged. Instead, a top-level attribute of the parent is replaced with a new one with the same name from the child.

The active configuration defines a page where the selected layout for the generated site is stored.
