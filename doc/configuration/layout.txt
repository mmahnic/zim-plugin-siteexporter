====== Layout selection ======
---
menu: "Layout selection"
---

A layout defines a set of templates and resources that are used to generate the site.
The layouts are usually stored under //00:layout//.
A layout may include:
	* Pandoc templates.
	* Translations for the templates.
	* CSS files.
	* Other files that go into site resources.

To select a layout for the site:
	* Define the //active// attribute on the //00:00.config// page to select the active configuration. The attribute represents a Zim path relative to //00:00.config//, for example with ''active: "example"'' we select the configuration page //00:00.config:example//.
	* Define the //layout// attribute on the //00:00.config:example// page. The attribute represents an absolute Zim path to the page with the layout definition, for example ''layout: "00:layout:w3css"''.
	* Define the [[:template|templates]] for the site as attachments of the page defined in the //layout// attribute.
	* Define the [[translation|transaltions]] for the template variables in subpages of the layout page.
