====== Page Type ======
---
menu: Page Type
---

The page type is specified in the page attribute //type//. If this attribute is not set on a page, the exporter will use the value of the attribute //childType// from parent pages. If //childType// is not found in parent pages, the page will have the default page type.

==== Page Type Processor ====
If a page type is specified in page attributes and a processor for that type is registered, the page will be processed by that processor. A processor typically generates new attributes and adds them to the page's extra attributes. The extra attributes are later used by the final converter (Pandoc).
A page processor may recognise and use additional page attributes.

==== Layout ====
If there is a template in the configured layout for the selected type it will be used by the final converter (Pandoc) to convert the page.
If there is a CSS file in the configured layout for the selected type it will be inserted into to the page in the YAML attribute //sx.main-css//. A template can then reference the attriubte to set the style of the page.
