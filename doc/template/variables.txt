When the exporter processes a page it generates a dictionary with variables that can be used in Pandoc templates. The dictionary is written into the YAML entry ''sx'' of the markdown page.

* //sx.navindex// - The index generated from published pages with the //menu// attribute. The variable is a list of records with the following members:
	* //id// - The Zim id of the page.
	* //display// - The value of the //menu// attribute of the page.
	* //link// - A link to the page. The link is relative to the page that is being exported.
	* //items// - The list of items of a submenu. Exists only when a submenu exists.
* //sx.tr// - The dictionary with the translated template variables.
* //sx.res// - The dictionary with page-relative paths to custom resurce files from the layout used by the template.
* //sx.home// - A link to the home page. The link is relative to the page that is being exported. The value is calculated from the //home// attribute in the [[:configuration|configuration]].
* //sx.main-css// - A link to the main CSS. The link is relative to the page that is being exported.
* //sx.meta-title// - The //metaTitle// ([[:attribute|attribute]]) of the page with added //titlePrefix// and //titleSuffix// ([[:configuration|configuration]]).
* //sx.news-activeitems//: Generated for pages of type '//news//' and contains the list of page's children that are published and not expired. Each child is described with a dictionary:
	* //id// - The Zim id of the page.
	* //title// - The title of the page.
	* //link// - A link to the child page. The link is relative to the page that is being exported.
	* //brief// - The brief text ([[:excerpt|excerpt]]) of the child page.
	* //date// - The date the page was published.

Other entries in ''sx'' are the variables from the original page that were not redefined by the exporter.
